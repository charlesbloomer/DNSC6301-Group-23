### Ethical considerations:
* **Describe potential negative impacts of using your model**:
  * Math or software problems: The model is "underspecified" and is likely to underperform in real-world practice. Changing the random seed of the model strongly affects the performance and results of an AIR higher than 0.8.
  * Real-world risks: The hispanic-to-white AIR could jump to more generalized conclusions about race or exclude other races from the model. The data in the model could show that race is tied too closely with other variables like sex, marriage, etc., and may not be as considerate of any outlier data that would show a different conclusion.
* **Describe potential uncertainties relating to the impacts of using your model**:
  * Math or software problems: The data set used for the model is an example of a poor data set for building models. The model is created as a project submission on the provided data and should not be used for practice. It only has a small number of customers and, all of the signal is in one variable, PAY_0.
  * Real-world risks: A major uncertainty regarding the impact of using the model is how it can display whether or not Hispanic people in the data set would be able to get a loan. This data model canâ€™t be used as an all-inclusive way to show correlation between Hispanic and/or white people getting a loan.
* **Describe any unexpected or results**:
  * This model cannot fix the bias. It can only remediate it, or to be specific, increase the tolerance with a higher estimated probability. Only by fixing the calculation of "phat" can we fix the bias problem of the model.
  * The model results can be significantly different with different seeds. This is probably because the dataset is not big enough and the importance of "PAY_0" is way higher than the rest of 18 variables. Below are some examples:

| **Seed** | 13579 | 24680| 12345|
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
|**hispanic-to-white AIR**| 0.75 | 0.88 | 0.76 |
| **black-to-white AIR** | 0.79 | 0.85 | 0.82 |
| **better cutoff** | 0.16 | 0.19 | 0.18
